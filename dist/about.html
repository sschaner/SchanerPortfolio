          <p>
            Since 2008, I have been opening young minds to the world of math. I
            have gained valuable skills in leadership, accountability, time
            management, and the ability to help others achieve success.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a passion for learning and have always had a love for
            technology and helping my community. I have been learning web
            development through online courses to grow as an individual and to
            give back to my community. I have the self-determination and problem
            solving skills to achieve success. I believe there's nothing better
            than a self-made developer with the passion to learn and grow. Being
            a self-determined and easy going team member, I will become an
            invaluable member to your team.

          I continually strive to improve myself in anything I do. Over the past
          few years, I have decided that I want to help local businesses by
          creating amazing looking and functional websites for them. I have
          taken and continue to take courses on Udemy to learn as much as I can
          about web development. I continue to learn and grow to create the best
          online experience.
